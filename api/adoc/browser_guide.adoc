Cypher is a graph-based query language for the Neo4J database.

Cypher can be used to write graph-based queries reminiscent of ASCII art.

A graph **G** is an ordered pair **(V**, **E)**, where stem: **V** is the set of all vertices and
**E** is the set of all edges.

== Create a node
:name: pass:a['<span value-key="name">Rüdiger</span>']

A node v of **V** can be represented by ().

This representation can be provided with the type. The operator : introduces such a type.

Here you see a node of the type person.
Each person has a name.
What name should the person have?:
++++
<input style="display:inline;width:30%;" value-for="name" class="form-control" value="Rüdiger" size="40">
++++

== Create a edge
An edge can only exist between two node.
An edge must always be directed.
The type of edge can be determined within [].
